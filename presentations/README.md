# Presentations
Please submit a PR with your presentation in a folder in this repo. Please prefix your folder name with the date of the meetup in the following format:
  * `YYYY-MM-DD-my-prezo-name-here`
  * `2019-08-21-docker-best-practices-for-golang`

If you have a separate git repo for your presentation, please include a PDF but also post the link in a `README.md`. Example:
  * `presentations/`
    * `2019-08-21-docker-best-practices-for-golang/`
      * `prezo.pdf`
      * `README.md`
